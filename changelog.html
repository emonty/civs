available for installation elsewhere, subject to certain restrictions
described in the included README file.

	<b>Note:</b> Another voting system, known as
	<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/civitas">
	Civitas</a>,
	is also under development at Cornell.
	This new system, described in a 
	<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/clarkson/papers/clarkson_civs_tr.pdf">technical report</a>,
	uses much more complex cryptographic protocols to provide universal verifability 
	and coercion resistance.  The new system is available for download,
	but it does not yet have a user interface.

<h2>
Recent updates
</h2>
<ul>
<li>2.16 (September 2012):</li>
    <ul>
	<li>Support for HTML voting code that can be pasted into other web pages (public polls only).</li>
	<li>Publication support. Top public polls now listed on home page.</li>
	<li>Localization for Spanish.</li>
        <li>Allow tracking voter identity in public elections.</li>
	<li>Clearer explanation of anonymity rules for elections with restricted
	    results.</li>
    </ul>
<li>2.15 (February 2011):</li>
    <ul>
	<li>Support for Hebrew, Portuguese, Chinese (<a href="acks.html">done by volunteers</a>)</li>
	<li>Bug fixes for UTF-8 email</li>
        <li>Other localization bug fixes</li>
	<li>Supervisors can remove write-ins before voting starts.</li>
    </ul>
<li>2.14 (May 2010):</li>
    <ul>
	<li>Improvements to the look of the voting page.</li>
	<li>Internationalization support including consistent use of UTF-8</li>
	<li>Localization for Hungarian, Italian, French, and German</li>
    (<a href="acks.html">done by volunteers</a>)
    </ul>
<li>2.13 (February 2010):</li>
    <ul>
	<li>Better algorithm for setting drag-and-drop rankings.</li>
	<li>Support multipliers in test ballot format</li>
	<li>Clearer explanation of proportional mode</li>
    </ul>

<li>2.12 (November 2009):</li>
<ul>
<li>Drag-and-drop voting UI.</li>
<li>Support for test polls in which ballots are uploaded.</li>
<li>Start time of polls recorded.</li>
<li>Better write-in filtering.</li>
<li>Fixed interaction with rigorous SMTP servers.</li>
</ul>

<li>2.11 (December 2008):</li>
<ul>
<li>Elections are now called "polls" uniformly, per a user suggestion.</li>
<li>Results are now cached, which should improve server performance
a great deal for large polls.</li>
<li>Schulze/beatpath algorithm now uses "against" preferences in addition to
"for" preferences. It now tends to agree with CIVS RP more often, perhaps
because it no longer throws away information that CIVS RP uses.</li>
<li>All completion methods are now in a standardized form, which makes
it easy to add new completion methods. It requires writing a Perl package
that implements <code>rank_candidates</code> and <code>print_details</code>,
and modifying two tables at the top of the "results" script.</li>

<li>Some formatting cleanup of code.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.10 (August 2008):</li>
<ul>
<li>Elections with write-ins now have voting initially disabled. It can
be enabled explicitly from the control page. This allows write-ins to
be on the same footing as other choices.</li>
<li>The election results page has a progress bar, which gives reassuring
feedback for the more expensive completion methods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.9 (January 2008):</li>
<ul>
<li>Added filtering of HTML tags to remove possible XSS attacks, etc. Most
useful HTML markup still permitted.</li>
<li>Cleanup of code and documentation.</li>
<li>Fixed a small but crippling bug in restricted release of results.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.8:</li>
<ul>
<li>Better checking of email addresses to prevent sending bogus emails.</li>
<li>Voter emails now come from CIVS supervisor instead of election supervisor.</li>
<li>Cleaned-up completion algorithm code allows adding new completion
    algorithms more easily.</li>
<li>Corrected description of runoff.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.7:</li>
<ul>
<li>Ability to release election results only to a limited set of users.</li>
<li>Better client-side sanity checking at election creation.</li>
<li>Previewing of election description and choice list.</li>
<li>Another completion algorithm (runoff)</li>
<li>Better factoring out of completion algorithms to allow future
    algorithms to be added more easily.</li>
<li>Allow voters' identity to be revealed as an election option</li>
<li>Mail to voters is now HTML+ASCII (should be made optional) to help
    get through spam filters.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
