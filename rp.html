<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Condorcet methods take into account the complete ranking of choices from every
voter, which means they have more information to use in picking the winner.
But just as important as the use of rankings is how those rankings are used.
Condorcet methods were invented by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Condorcet">
Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, marquis de Condorcet</a>.
</p>
<p>
Condorcet election methods have been called Instant Round-Robin Voting because
they use the voters' rankings to compare every choice against every other in
head-to-head contests. Intuitively, it would not make sense if the winner lost
in a head-to-head contest with some other choice.  Condorcet methods aim to
prevent such an outcome.

</p>
<p>
The voters are considered to collectively have a preference for choice A over
choice B if A is ranked higher than B on more ballots than B is ranked higher
than A on. If the voters prefer a choice A to every other choice, choice A is
the <b>Condorcet winner</b> (CW).  An election method is a <b>Condorcet method</b> if it is guaranteed to elect the Condorcet winner, when one exists. 
</p>
<p>
Although there is usually a Condorcet winner, especially when there are
many voters, it is possible that there isn't one.
In ranked-preference voting systems, <b>preference
cycles</b> may exist. For example, it is possible that on most ballots, choice
A is preferred to choice B, on most ballots B is preferred to C, and
on most ballots C is preferred to A. Fortunately, cycles involving the
top-ranked choice don't seem to happen often. And there are good methods for
resolving these cycles, called <b>completion rules</b>.
If the goal of the election is simply to pick the top choice,
it usually doesn't matter which completion rule is used.
</p>

<p>
In the CIVS election result report, the color coding of the final
preference matrix tells you whether a completion rule was needed. If
there are no red cells above the diagonal (or green cells below it),
then there are no cycles for a completion rule to resolve, and it
doesn't matter what completion rule is used.
</p>

<h3>Supported completion rules</h3>

<p>CIVS currently supports four rules for Condorcet completion:
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method">Schulze method</a>
(also known as Beatpath Winner and
Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping),
<a href="http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~seppley/">
Maximize Affirmed Majorities</a> (MAM), a deterministic variant of MAM
called <a href="#rp">CIVS Ranked Pairs</a>, and a runoff-based
Condorcet algorithm called <a href="#runoff">Condorcet-IRV</a>.
The first two rules are described
elsewhere (follow the links); CIVS Ranked Pairs and Condorcet-IRV are
described below. 
</p>

<p>
CIVS does not impose a completion rule; in fact, anyone viewing the results of
an election can see what the results would have been with each of the rules. It
is probably a good idea for the election supervisor to decide on an rule ahead
of time, and include it in the election description.  On the other hand, all
four rules usually agree with each other, especially on the ranking of the
first few choices.
</p>

<h2>Which completion rule should I use?</h2>
<p>
Usually it doesn't matter which completion rule is used, because there is a
Condorcet winner, in which case all the rules will agree.  If all four rules
agree, you can be confident that you're getting the right result.  However,
it's a good idea to commit to the rule you're going to use ahead of time, to
avoid arguments later on.
</p>

<p>
The different rules have advantages and disadvantages. Beatpath Winner (Schulze)
can be computed very cheaply using the Floyd-Warshall all-pairs-shortest-paths
algorithm. Because of its simplicity and computational efficiency,
it is probably the best known and most widely used method.
The two ranked-pairs rules (CIVS Ranked Pairs and MAM) are more
expensive to compute.  If there are <i>n</i> choices, the ranked pairs
algorithms are about <i>n</i> times slower than Beatpath Winner. This
slowdown is only noticeable if there are many choices (more than twenty).
Anecdotally, Beatpath Winner seems to be less stable than the other three
rules, in the sense that adding one ballot to the set of ballots can have a
large effect on the rankings, perhaps because one ballot can create a
long new beatpath with global effects.
Methods based on ranked pairs seem to be
more stable in the sense that a given voter's ballot tends not to affect the
ordering as much. The difference between the two ranked pairs methods,
CIVS Ranked Pairs and MAM, is that MAM uses a sophisticated random tie-breaking method, whereas
CIVS Ranked Pairs is completely deterministic. Thus, the result of running MAM
is not determined by just the ballots cast. Comparison of the results of MAM
and CIVS RP will show if randomization was needed and used by MAM.  If there is
a lot of concern about strategic voting (particularly, burying attacks),
Condorcet-IRV is a reasonable choice.

<h2>CIVS Ranked Pairs</h2>
</a>

<p>The CIVS Ranked Pairs completion rule is a deterministic
variant of Eppley's MAM method;
it is also related to other completion methods such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_Pairs">
Tideman Ranked Pairs</a>.
In these algorithms, each of the pairwise preferences in the preference matrix
is considered in in the order of the strength of the preference, and
<b>kept</b> (<b>affirmed</b>) if it does not create cycles with previously
kept preferences. Otherwise, the preference is ignored because it is in
conflict with stronger preferences.

<h3>Affirming preferences</h3>

<p>
In the CIVS ranked
pairs algorithm, as in MAM, one preference is stronger than another if it has
more votes in favor, or if the number of votes in favor are equal, if the
preference has fewer votes against.  Of course, it is entirely possible that
two preferences have exactly the same number of votes in favor and against.
Like MAM and unlike Tideman, the ordering of preferences does not take margins
into account.
</p>

<p>
The major difference between CIVS Ranked Pairs and MAM is
the rule on when to keep a preference. In CIVS RP, a preference is
kept exactly when it does not create any <i>new</i> cycles when considered in
conjunction with <i>strictly stronger</i>, kept preferences. Thus, preferences
of equal strength may be kept even though in conjunction they produce a new
cycle, as long as <i>individually</i> they do not.
</p>
<p>
CIVS RP is a deterministic method that does not use randomness, unlike MAM (and
some other voting methods).  Voting methods that rely on randomness need to
have a mechanism for generating randomness in a trustworthy way, because
otherwise the voting system itself might cheat by generating randomness until
the best possible outcome is achieved from the viewpoint of whoever controls
the randomness.
</p>

<h3>Ranking the choices</h3>

<p>
The algorithm for ranking the various choices is to successively identify the
Schwartz sets defined by the graph of kept preferences.  The top-ranked choices
are the initial Schwartz set: the smallest set of choices such that no choices
outside the set are preferred to any in the set. After these choices are
removed from the graph, the second tier of choices are the Schwartz set in the
new graph, and so on. Typically, the Schwartz set consists of a single choice
at every level; ties can only occur if there are preferences of equal strength.
When a Schwartz set contains multiple choices, there must be a cycle of kept
preferences. In this case, the choices within that Schwartz set are ranked
based on the strength of the strongest preference against that choice (note
that preferences involving choices from higher-ranked Schwartz sets are not
germane for this comparison).
</p>

<h2>Condorcet-IRV</h2>
</a>

<p>
The Condorcet-IRV rule is a Condorcet completion rule that uses an IRV-like
process to perform Condorcet completion. It was originally proposed by
Thomas Hill of England's Electoral Reform Society.
Given a set of choices, this
algorithm finds the top-ranked choice (or choices) in the following way.  If
there is a Condorcet winner, that is the top-ranked choice. Otherwise, for each
choice, the ballots are examined to see on how many of the ballots that choice
is the highest ranked among the choices being considered.  Call this number the
top count for the choice. The choice with the smallest count is removed from
consideration and the process repeats, looking for a CW among the remaining
choices. (If multiple choices tie for having the smallest top count, one is
randomly picked for removal.) Eventually, there will either be a Condorcet
winner, or the remaining choices will all have the same top count. The
remaining choice or choices are then considered the top-ranked choices among
the set.  CIVS repeats this algorithm to construct a ranking of all choices.
</p>
<p>
Note that although this rule uses a runoff procedure to eliminate
&ldquo;weak&rdquo; choices who create a cycle in the preference graph,
it is still a Condorcet election method, unlike IRV/STV.  If there is a
CW, it will always be the top-ranked choice.
</p>
<p>
The advantage of Condorcet-IRV is that it is relatively resistant to certain
kinds of strategic voting. In particular, it resists <i>burying</i>, an attack
in which voters insincerely push strong competitors to their preferred choices
lower in the rankings. A weaker form of <i>burying</i> is <i>truncation</i>, in
which voters do not express their full preference by giving some set of
choices the lowest possible rank.  As long as burying does not create a
preference cycle, it has no effect on any Condorcet method. However, it is
possible for burying to create a preference cycle that many completion
rules will then resolve in favor of the choice of the voters who have voted
insincerely.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of the completion rule, burying can easily backfire on voters
who employ it, because it can result in weaker choices appearing to be consensus
choices. A successful use of burying can be tricky to carry off; the best
policy is to vote sincerely.
